**Christopher Handwerk, DLR guide** — So, DLR (_Deutsches Zentrum für Luft- und Raumfahrt_) works together with universities for example, in field of basic studies, as well as partners from industries, in the field of applied research. The other function of the DLR is to bridge the gap between basic research and applied research.

The scientific missions includes exploration of the solar system and Earth, research to protect the environment, as well as development of environment friendly tech for energy supply, future mobility, navigation, communication and security.

In addition to his own researches, DLR is Germany' space agency, and on behalf of the german government, it is responsible of planning and implementation of the german space program. So DLR integrates every german space activity on national and european level.

And third, DRL is a project management agency, and as such is specialized on educational and innovation programs; it supports the funding of sucgh programs and projets, the transfer of knowledge into different fields as well as the general utilization of knowledge.

Sp to sum it up, DLR combines three functions:

- the research institure;
- the Germany space agency; and
- the projects management agenty.

All of this takes place on twenty sites in Germany with 8200 employees at the moment, the largest being Oberpfaffenhofen near Munich, with 1800 employees, Cologne being the second largest with 1000 employees, as well as the headquarters of the central administration of DLR.

**Unknown Visitor** — I was wondering, do you know where the DLR logo comes from?

**Guide** — Yeah. I know that.

**Ute** — Will you tell?

**Guide** — There are two parallelograms. The horizontal one is somehow like an airplane; indicates one of the main research field. The other one, more or less vertical one, indicates a starting rocket: that's the space parallelogram.

# DLR Solar Oven

**Guide** — […] solar research uses facilities to concentrate solar radiations on focus points to produce heat, solar thermal energy. The solar oven has an off-axis setup; there is a plain mirror called the helix start, and the helix start reflects solar radiations to a concentrator, witch is behind this rolling door over there, and the concentrator concentrates the solar radiations into the laboratory building.
